### Financial Markets Classification

There is a problem in the financial world, different platforms and different companies uses different standards to describe same security or asset type, or same companies some times have several different equities on different markets with same or similar names. 

To solve this problem I decided to review different types of data platforms and setup a unified way to describe data.
